#Demo

The FindVisor is a website focused on improving students knowledge on daily financial planning and will have an in-built calculator for calculating student loans. If time permits it, we might also build in an advisor (which will have fun facts about taxes, housing decision (down payments, and loans), stocks, bonds, and life insurance.) I want the app to be interactive, and help the future generations plan life better.
